Running main.py will run the program.

Current design features:
    Capable of moving to individual wells (to check)
    Capable of moving along specified rows (to check)
    Calibration


Necessary changes:
    Moving to all wells (iterated row movement)
    Integration with optics (possible timer, or a command from the computer)
        Includes the dipping, part of making the system function
    Adding the option to input your own gcode commands directly
    Remove the "Edit gcode" feature
    Make the progress bar work
    Add a signal indicating the arduino is connected
    New stepper drivers
    Add errors
    Styling
    Making the UI better match the program requirements


This currently runs on Python 12.4 through a virtual environment.
Libraries include:
    PySide6 version 6.7.2
    Pyserial version 3.5
Anything greater than or equal to these should work.

The folder named "ui" contains the files used to create the UI using the open-source version of QT Creator: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source. It is available on another repo. QT Creator is a pain to work with.

The folder named "Marlin" contains the Marlin 2.1.2.4 code used on the Arduino Mega: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware. The main change files are Marlin/Configuration.h, Marlin/Configuration_adv.h, and Marlin/src/pins/mega/pins_MEGACONTROLLER.h. These files will replace those in Marlin 2.1.2.4. Full changes are below:
